Prof. Buy, Glady, and I met in order to walk through to code to further develop our understanding. I was tasked with identifiy and add comments the files that we would need to cahnge in order to implement the protocol. At the end of the week we all met with Prof. Parthasarathy to discuss a refinemnt to the protocol along with a more definitive explanation of the protocol we currently have.
