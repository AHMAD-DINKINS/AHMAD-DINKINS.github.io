During this first week, we held multiple meetings with Coalition to gain more insight about how their code works. In the meetings, a developer would give us a high level of what each of the classes did and show us the slow of the app. At this time, we do not have access to the full app so we are unable to begin impelenting our protocol. The team that will work on implementation is composed of Professor Ugo Buy from UIC, his gradute student Glady Thomas, and Angello Astorga who is a graudte student of UIUC.
