We have finished the initial implementation of the bluetooth handshake and have asked for Coalition to review it. We have also started to test the implementation ourselves, but we cannont proceed because of a few problems trying to get devices to connect to each other. We have also asked Coalition if they can provide any insight on this problem. We also met with the graduate student who is building the PSI libraries that we will use to determine who an infected user has come in conatact with. During this meeting we went over how to use the library modules.
