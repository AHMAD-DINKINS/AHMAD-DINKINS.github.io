 Glady and I have begun implementing the Handshake part of the protocol and plan to implement the PSI step afterwards. On most days, the two of us meet sometime in the morning to discuss each other's progress and make any necessary changes. We then meet with Prof. Buy in the evening for a final code review. This incremental process of development has helped me learn how to code as a part of a team, rather than as an individual. I think this process of development works really well.
